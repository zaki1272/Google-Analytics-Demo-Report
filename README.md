## Google-Analytics-Demo-Report
#### This project demonstrates various KPIs related to Google Analytics data of an online retail store. The KPIs are related to devices, users, pages, sessions, transactions, campaigns, bounce rate, etc. 

#### Data has been extracted by writing a script in Python, and then transformed using data build tool (dbt). The report has several pages, where each one is centered around a specific KPI. For example, in the page called 'sessions', all the visuals created will be related to the sessions on the website.
